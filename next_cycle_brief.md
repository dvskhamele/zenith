# Next Cycle Brief - 2025-08-31

## Primary Objective

Resolve the `spawn bash ENOENT` error to enable execution of shell commands, which is critical for:
- Starting the local development server.
- Running linting and testing tools for code verification.
- Building backend functions for marketing automation.

## Marketing-Related Development (Pending)

Once the environment issue is resolved, continue with Phase 3 of the "Psyche-Architect Protocol":

### Build Growth Flywheel Infrastructure
- Develop backend functions for Programmatic SEO, Viral Loops, Content Syndication, or Scheduled Tasks as outlined in `PLAN.md`.

### Build Email Automation Infrastructure
- Develop backend functions and triggers for automated emails, including registration notifications to `dvskha@gmail.com`.

## Verification (Blocked)

- Execute linting on new code.
- Generate and run task-scoped E2E tests for implemented features.
