- Implemented the marketing-focused UI/UX as per the strategic plan:
    - Moved the existing application dashboard from `/` to `/dashboard`.
    - Created a new conversion-optimized homepage at `/` (based on `docs__high_level_strategic_plan.md`).
    - Created a dedicated pricing page at `/pricing` (based on `docs__high_level_strategic_plan.md`).
    - Created the core image generation tool page at `/tool` (based on `docs__high_level_strategic_plan.md`).

    - Created a marketing page for the Bulk Upload feature at `/bulk-upload`.
    - Created a marketing page for the AI Content Assistant feature at `/ai-assistant`.
    - Created a marketing page for the Automated Reports feature at `/automated-reports`.

        - Simplified Client Portals (`/client-portals`)
        - Auto-Plug (Promotional Comment Automation) (`/auto-plug`)
        - Auto-DM Campaigns (`/auto-dm-campaigns`)
        - Auto-Retweet (Best Post Recycling) (`/auto-retweet`)

### Environmental Issues & Blockers

- Encountered persistent `spawn bash ENOENT` error when attempting to run shell commands (`supabase start`, `npm install`, `ls -la`, `git add`). This prevents server startup, execution of linting/testing tools, and git operations, thus blocking full verification of changes and further backend development related to marketing automation (e.g., email automation, growth flywheel infrastructure).
